# Context7 MCP Integration Guidelines

## API Communication
- All external API calls must go through the Context7 MCP server
- Implement proper error handling for MCP server responses
- Use appropriate fallback mechanisms for failed requests
- Cache responses when appropriate to reduce server load

## Documentation Requirements
- Always resolve library IDs before making documentation requests
- Document all MCP server interactions with clear comments
- Include error handling strategies in documentation
- Maintain clear separation between MCP and application logic

## Performance Guidelines
- Implement proper caching strategies for documentation responses
- Use batch requests when possible to reduce server load
- Monitor response times and implement appropriate timeouts
- Handle rate limiting gracefully

## Error Handling
- Implement graceful fallbacks for all MCP server errors
- Log all errors with appropriate context
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Maintain application stability during MCP server outages

## Security Considerations
- Validate all responses from MCP server
- Implement proper authentication mechanisms
- Follow secure data handling practices
- Monitor and log suspicious activities
